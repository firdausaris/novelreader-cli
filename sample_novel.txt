Chapter 1: The Discovery

The old library creaked in the wind, its weathered wooden shelves holding secrets that had been forgotten for decades. Sarah pushed open the heavy oak door, dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunlight that streamed through the tall windows.

"Hello? Anyone here?" she called out, her voice echoing through the empty halls.

A rustling sound came from the back corner, near the ancient reference section. Sarah walked cautiously toward the noise, her footsteps muffled by the thick carpet.

"You shouldn't be here," a gravelly voice said from the shadows.

Sarah jumped, her heart racing. "I'm sorry, I didn't know anyone was here. The door was unlocked."

An elderly man emerged from behind a towering bookshelf, his wild gray hair and thick glasses giving him the appearance of a mad scientist. "Most people can't even see this place anymore," he muttered, adjusting his spectacles.

"What do you mean?" Sarah asked, genuinely curious.

The old man studied her for a moment, as if weighing whether to trust her with something important. "This isn't just any library, young lady. This is the Repository of Lost Stories."

Sarah felt a chill run down her spine. There was something about the way he said it that made her believe every word.

"Lost stories?"

"Every tale that was never finished, every character that was abandoned by their author, every world that was left incomplete," he explained, gesturing to the endless rows of books. "They all end up here, waiting."

"Waiting for what?" Sarah whispered.

The old man smiled mysteriously. "For someone like you to find them and give them the ending they deserve."
